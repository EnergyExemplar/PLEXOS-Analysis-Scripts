# PLEXOS Analysis Scripts

This is a library of Python scripts that can be used with PLEXOS to perform different types of advanced analysis. 
Some of these analyses leverage the PLEXOS API, which is described in detail in a separate repository.
Each grouping of scripts should come with some documentation that describes how to run the script and what
PLEXOS modeling requirements are related to its utilization.
